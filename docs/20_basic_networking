# Module 2: Network Components, Types, and Connections

## 2.1 Clients and Servers

### 2.1.1 Client and Server Roles
- **Client**: A device that requests information or services (e.g., web browser).
- **Server**: A device that provides information or services to other devices.
- **Example**: A web server delivers websites to client devices using HTTP.

### 2.1.2 Peer-to-Peer Networks
- No centralized server.
- Each device can act as both a **client** and a **server**.
- Common in small-scale environments or ad-hoc file sharing.

### 2.1.3 Peer-to-Peer Applications
- Examples include BitTorrent, Skype, and some online games.
- Efficient for decentralized communication and resource sharing.

### 2.1.4 Multiple Roles in the Network
- Most devices today can perform multiple roles.
- Example: A laptop can act as a web server (localhost), client (browser), and file-sharing peer.

## 2.2 Network Components

### 2.2.1 Network Infrastructure
- Composed of physical and logical components that support communication:
  - **Switches**: Connect devices within a LAN.
  - **Routers**: Connect different networks (LAN to WAN).
  - **Firewalls**: Protect networks by filtering traffic.
  - **Access Points (APs)**: Provide wireless connectivity.

### 2.2.2 End Devices
- Devices that **send or receive** network data:
  - Computers, laptops, smartphones, printers, IoT devices.
- Also known as **hosts**, they form the interface between user and network.

## 2.3 ISP Connectivity Options

### 2.3.1 ISP Services
- Internet Service Providers offer:
  - Web hosting
  - Email services
  - Cloud storage
  - Internet access (wired and wireless)

### 2.3.2 ISP Connections
- Types of physical media:
  - **Coaxial cable**
  - **Twisted pair (DSL)**
  - **Fiber-optic**
  - **Wireless (cellular, satellite)**

### 2.3.3 Cable and DSL Connections
- **Cable Internet**:
  - Uses coaxial cable, shared bandwidth with neighbors.
  - Typically faster than DSL.
- **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)**:
  - Uses telephone lines, dedicated bandwidth per user.
  - Speeds vary with distance from ISP central office.

### 2.3.4 Additional Connectivity Options
- **Fiber-Optic**: High-speed, long-distance, immune to interference.
- **Cellular Networks**: 4G/5G for mobile devices and remote access.
- **Satellite**: Used in rural/remote areas with limited wired infrastructure.
- **Fixed Wireless**: Uses radio signals between towers and homes.
