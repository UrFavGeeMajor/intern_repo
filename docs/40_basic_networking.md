# Module 4: Build A Home Network

## 4.1 Home Network Basics

### 4.1.1 Typical Home Network Setup
- Most home networks follow a **star topology**:
  - Internet → Router → Devices (wired/wireless)
- Includes a **modem**, **router**, and **end devices** like phones, laptops, TVs, and smart devices.

### 4.1.2 Components Of A Home Network
- **Router**: Connects home network to the internet.
- **Switch**: Expands wired connections (optional).
- **Access Point**: Extends wireless range (optional).
- **Cabling**: Usually CAT5e/CAT6 Ethernet for wired.
- **End Devices**: Smartphones, PCs, IoT, printers.

### 4.1.3 Typical Home Network Router
- Combines **router**, **switch**, and **wireless access point** in one box.
- Often includes:
  - DHCP server
  - NAT firewall
  - Port forwarding
  - Parental controls

## 4.2 Network Technologies In The Home

### 4.2.1 LAN Wireless Frequencies
- **2.4 GHz**:
  - Wider range, more interference
  - Better wall penetration
- **5 GHz**:
  - Higher speed, shorter range
  - Less interference, more channels

### 4.2.2 Wired Network Technologies
- **Ethernet (CAT5e, CAT6)**: Stable and fast.
- **Powerline Adapters**: Use electrical wiring for network traffic.
- **MoCA**: Uses coaxial cable for high-speed data.

## 4.3 Wireless Standards

### 4.3.1 WiFi Networks
- **802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax (Wi-Fi 6)** standards.
- Each has different speed, range, and frequency.
- Most modern routers support multiple standards simultaneously.

### 4.3.2 Wireless Settings
- Configure:
  - **SSID**
  - **Password** (WPA2/WPA3 recommended)
  - **Channel** (manual/auto)
  - **Guest Network**
  - MAC filtering, QoS, parental controls

## 4.4 Set Up A Home Router

### 4.4.1 First Time Setup
- Connect to the router via **web interface** (usually 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1).
- Set admin password.
- Configure SSID and wireless security.
- Enable firmware updates.

### 4.4.2 Design Considerations
- Router placement: central, elevated, open space.
- Minimize obstructions (walls, metal).
- Consider mesh systems for larger homes.

### 4.4.4 Configure A Wireless Router and Client
- Wireless router: set SSID, password, network mode, channel.
- Client device: scan for SSID → enter password → connect.
- Test connection and troubleshoot if needed.
