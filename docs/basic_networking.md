## 1.1 Network Types

Covers the different types of networks based on their scope and structure:

- **PAN (Personal Area Network)** – very small, e.g., Bluetooth devices.
- **LAN (Local Area Network)** – used within homes or offices.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)** – covers larger geographic areas, like the Internet.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** – spans a city or campus.
- **WLAN (Wireless LAN)** – wireless version of LAN, typically using Wi-Fi.
- **SAN (Storage Area Network)** – specialized for high-speed storage access.

## 1.2 Data Transmission

Focuses on how data is moved through a network:

- **Analog vs Digital Signals**
- **Simplex, Half-Duplex, and Full-Duplex Communication**
- **Serial vs Parallel Transmission**

## 1.3 Bandwidth and Throughput

Explains the distinction between:

- **Bandwidth** – The theoretical maximum data transfer capacity of a medium.
- **Throughput** – The actual data transferred over time, often less due to interference and delays.
- **Latency** – Delay in packet delivery.
- **Jitter** – Variability in packet arrival time.
